# stripling
this project is a http server based on linux epoll. it has load balance like nginx for each work process
it is now just used for static html page. dynamic web page is not support.

if you want to run it. you enter the stripling directory and run the configure script first and then you 
can use make command to compile the code. the executable file will be stored in bin directory.
there is some config item you can change. if you do not want to use the default configuration,
you should edit the config.txt before run the configure script.
